# TODO

This file shows a few steps I'm yet to perform.

**General**

- Confirm consistency of metrics in REPORTS.md.

**van Gogh**

- Reduce quality of images in van gogh's museum van gogh test recaptures and
  retest. Check if this improves the current low accurate predictions.
  - try 2 or 3 different resolutions
- Combine patches and recaptures using Folego's approach.

**Painter by Numbers**

- Finish training of predicting networks.
- Saliency on the first 100 painters.
- Check guided backprop consistency.
